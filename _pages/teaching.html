## Teaching Philosophy

Teaching has always been a rewarding part of my academic journey. I aim to create an environment where students not only learn technical material but also develop a strong intuitive grasp of the underlying ideas. My goal is to help students visualize and internalize the concepts — to understand not just what an equation says, but why it says it, almost as if they’re reading a meaningful sentence in their native language.

I focus on guiding students step by step through both theory and application, carefully tracking their comprehension and remaining attentive to where their understanding might hesitate or deepen. I try to make learning a natural and almost subconscious process by emphasizing key ideas, offering multiple visual perspectives, and reinforcing core concepts through repetition, structured outlines, and layered reviews. Ultimately, I hope to help students build lasting intuition and confidence in both abstract thinking and practical problem-solving.

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to my homepage, and thank you for visiting. My name is **Abolfazl Shahrooei**, though I often go by **Abol** for short â€” it's simpler, and I enjoy the familiarity it brings. I am currently a **Ph.D. student** in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University**.

My research lies at the intersection of **advanced signal processing**, **physics-informed machine learning**, and the **intelligent modeling and control of high-impact, physically grounded systems**. I apply these tools to several domains with real-world significance, including:

- **Neurorehabilitation robotics**, focusing on intuitive control of assistive hand exoskeletons for individuals post-stroke  
- **Battery management systems**, especially in predictive modeling and real-time state estimation  
- **Autonomous systems**, where robust, data-driven control must operate under real-time physical constraints

I am currently a **Graduate Research Assistant** in the **Hand Rehabilitation Lab**, where I work under the supervision of **Professor Derek Kamper**. My current research focuses on the **real-time control of assistive hand exoskeletons** using **high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG)** to decode neural intent in individuals recovering from stroke.

Please feel free to reach out if you have questions, ideas, or are interested in collaboration. Iâ€™m always happy to connect.

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Welcome to my homepage, and thank you for stopping by. My name is Abolfazl Shahrooei, though I often go by Abol for simplicity. 

Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University. My research lies at the intersection of application-driven signal processing, physics-informed machine learning, and modeling and control for dynamical systems.

At NC State, Iâ€™m privileged to be a graduate research assistant in the **Hand Rehabilitation Lab**, under the mentorship of [Professor Derek Kamper](https://www.bme.ncsu.edu/people/dakamper/). My current research focuses on the real-time control of assistive hand exoskeletons using high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) to decode neural intent in individuals recovering from stroke.

If youâ€™re interested in my research, have questions, or are exploring potential collaborations, Iâ€™d be delighted to connect.

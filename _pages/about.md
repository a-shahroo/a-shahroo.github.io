**Site Under Construction! **

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to my homepage, and thank you for stopping by. My name is **Abolfazl Shahrooei**, though I often go by **Abol** for simplicity. I am currently a Ph.D. student in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University**.

My research lies at the intersection of **application-driven signal processing**, **physics-informed machine learning**, and the **intelligent modeling and control of high-impact, physically grounded systems**. I apply these tools to several domains with real-world significance, including:

- **Neurorehabilitation robotics**, focusing on intuitive control of assistive hand exoskeletons for individuals post-stroke  
- **Battery management systems**, specifically SOC and SOH estimation for Li-ion batteries and EVs
- **Autonomous systems**, where robust, data-driven control must operate under tight safety constraints

I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant in the [**Hand Rehabilitation Lab**](https://handrehablab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/), where I work under the supervision of [**Professor Derek Kamper**](https://bme.unc.edu/bme-person/derek-kamper/). My current research focuses on the **real-time control of assistive hand exoskeletons** using **high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG)** to decode neural intent in individuals recovering from stroke.

If you're interested in my research, have questions, or are exploring potential collaborations, Iâ€™d be delighted to connect.

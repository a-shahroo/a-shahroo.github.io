Under Construction!
======

Welcome to my homepage, and thank you for visiting. My name is Abolfazl Shahrooei, though I often go by Abol for short — it's simpler, and I enjoy the familiarity it brings. I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University.

My research lies at the intersection of advanced signal processing, physics-informed machine learning, and the intelligent modeling and control of high-impact, physically grounded systems. I apply these tools to several domains with real-world significance, including:

Neurorehabilitation robotics, focusing on intuitive control of assistive hand exoskeletons for individuals post-stroke

Battery management systems, especially in predictive modeling and real-time state estimation

Autonomous systems, where robust, data-driven control must operate under real-time physical constraints

I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant in the Hand Rehabilitation Lab, where I work under the supervision of Professor Derek Kamper. My current research focuses on the real-time control of assistive hand exoskeletons using high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) to decode neural intent in individuals recovering from stroke.

Please feel free to reach out if you have questions, ideas, or are interested in collaboration. I’m always happy to connect.
